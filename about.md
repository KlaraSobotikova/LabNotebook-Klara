My thesis project focuses on unerstanding the response of opihi, an endemic Hawaiian limpet, to thermal and desiccation stress. By measuring heart rate, body temperature, and analyzing differential gene expression between stressed and non-stressed animals, I aim to understand the adaptive capacity of these intertidal organisms.
